<h4/> The image above is the first screen of the registration form made with React JS during Alura's React course.

<h4> Some features and topics of the project:</h4>
<ul>
  <li/>This form uses React's function components instead of class components.
  <li/>During the development 3 native hooks were used and 1 custom hook was created, the "useErrors".
  <li/>The Material UI library was used to help prototyping the project's layout with the TextField, Button, Switch, Stepper among other components. 
  <li/>After Alura's classes were finished I added a new section and validations for the form as a challenge: 
  Implement the payment section with the card number, card owner, card flag and security code fields and validations for each one.
  <li/>Since there is still no back-end implementation, when you finish the registration all your data will be printed as an object on the browser console.
</ul>
